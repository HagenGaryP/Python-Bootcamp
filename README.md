Unfortunately, the code doesn't show up the same way on github as it did
using Microsoft's Azure (Jupyter) Notebooks.

Some of the code cells are blank, but the output is there, and vice versa...
However, my notes are still helpful, at lest for me.

I will try to update this with all of my original code and testing,
including additional notes in each code cell, before Microsoft retires
the Azure Notebooks preview website (Oct 9th, 2020).
